TODO
----
o Init several interpreters at startup.

o Interpreter pool manager that cleans up the number of interpreters back down
  to the minimum if the system is idle.

o Forking interpreters with IPC instead of threaded. (Since perlthreads are
  becoming more stable, this should become less relevant down the road)
