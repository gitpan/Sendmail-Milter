About Sendmail::Milter
----------------------

Sendmail::Milter provides users with the ability to write mail filters in Perl
that tightly integrate with sendmail's mail filter API.

With this module, you can define and register Perl callbacks with the Milter
engine. This module calls your perl callbacks using interpreters from a
threaded persistent interpreter pool. Milter contexts are presented using an
object-oriented style interface for performing operations on a Milter context.

The main project web page for this module is:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/sendmail-milter/


Prerequisites
-------------

Sendmail::Milter has been tested with the following:

    sendmail 8.11.0 built with -D_FFR_MILTER=1
    perl 5.6.0 built with -Dusethreads

You can find the latest version of sendmail from:

    ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/

You can try this module out with newer versions of Perl, hopefully interpreter
threads support will come out of its experimental state in the future.

You'll also need to have an operating system with a viable POSIX threads
implementation.

This module has only been tested on FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE. Your mileage may vary.

Sendmail::Milter uses the new perl_clone() call in 5.6.0 to make copies of the
Perl interpreter for its interpreter pools (see intpools.c and intpools.h). See
the perldelta manpage for more information on this feature.


Before You Begin
----------------

Read the libmilter/README file that comes with the sendmail source
distribution to find out how to build sendmail with the Mail Filter API.


Building Sendmail::Milter
-------------------------

Begin by building sendmail, libmilter, and perl with -Dusethreads. Next,
perform the following commands:

% perl Makefile.PL ../sendmail ../sendmail/obj.FreeBSD.4.0-RELEASE.i386
% make
% make install

The paths ../sendmail and ../sendmail/obj.FreeBSD.4.0-RELEASE.i386 should point
to the sendmail source tree and the sendmail build directory, respectively.


Using Sendmail::Milter
----------------------

See the pod documentation for complete information on writing your own mail
filters with this module.


Testing the sample sample.pl mail filter
----------------------------------------

sample.pl, a sample test case has been provided. You can run it by using the
following command:

% perl sample.pl myfilter /etc/mail/sendmail.cf

But before you do that, add a line similar to:

INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`myfilter', `S=local:/var/run/perl.sock')dnl

to your .mc file. sample.pl isn't terribly interesting, but should give you a
good feel for how mail filters are written with Sendmail::Milter.


Mailing List
------------

You can subscribe to the sendmail-milter-users@lists.sourceforge.net mailing
list. Instructions on how to do so can be found off the Sendmail::Milter
project page.
